Full Stack Web Developer
<http://lynncyrin.me>  // lynncyrin@gmail.com

Professional full stack web developer with 3 years of industry experience working in multifunctional roles on self-sufficient, agile teams. Looking for (in order of preference) contract / part time / full time work in Portland, Oregon or remote.

My nontechnical work revolves around community, access, identity, and diversity. The majority of this work is heavily integrated with online communities and social media. I expect any organization I work with to support organizations like Transh4ck and Women Who Code.
